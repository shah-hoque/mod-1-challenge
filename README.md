# Codebase refactored to meet accessibility standards so that it's optimized for search engines

## Description
The original codebase was downloaded from https://courses.bootcampspot.com

- The motivation behind this refactoring was mainly to add alt text to images so that search engines like Google can better find this website

- This project was built to showcase Horiseon's services online which seeks to work with more clients

- A few problems solved in this codebase:
    - replaced tags with semantic tags
    - fixed missing/duplicated tags
    - organised the codebase with comments
    - added alt text to images
    - removed unnecessary css class tags
    - grouped styles in the css sheet
    - wrote this README file
    - fixed grammar errors
    - published site to Git Pages

- A few things I've learnt:
    - how to edit css styles
    - how to publish a Git page website
    - how to write code using the Live Server exention
    - how to write alt tags
    - how to organise code better
    - and more
